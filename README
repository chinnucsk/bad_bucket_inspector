In response to a question[1] on the mailing list about scripting read repair, I wrapped this[2] function contrib in an escript using rebar's escriptize feature.

NOTE: this is generally a bad idea, and there are no doubt much better ways to script read repair, I just did it as some throw-away code as an example. Beware: it downloads *and compiles* ALL of riak_kv as a dependency, m'kay.

Far better just to attach and run the function contrib in the console.

./rebar get-deps
./rebar compile
[make tea, drink tea]
./rebar skip-deps=true escriptize
./bi my_buket riak@127.0.0.1
